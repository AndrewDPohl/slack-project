# Slack Project

* Static Photo Website Task for Slack Interview

# Overview

* Access a public API, in this case Flickr
* Grab a set of photo and render them onto a page
* On click, render a larger version of the photo in a lightbox, with the ability to scroll through the rest of the photos in the set.  Nav should work both forward and backward
* Use only native Javascript, so no JS libraries
