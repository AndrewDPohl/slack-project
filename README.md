Static Photo Website Task for Slack Interview

The objective is to create a static page that will display a group of photos that are being called via a public API, in this case using FLICKR.  

A user should be able to click on any photo to open up a lightbox, displaying that photo.  The user should also be able to move forward or backward through the group of photos in order when the lightbox is opened.  

For this quick project I used the FLICKR API, and some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
